- Open the project in your prefered code editor.
- Go to terminal -> New terminal (If you are using VS code)
- Split your terminal into two (run the client on one terminal and the server on the other terminal)

In the first terminal
- cd client and create a .env file in the root of your client directory.
- Supply the following credentials

```
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = 
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL='http://localhost:8000'
```

To get your Google ClientID for authentication, go to the [credential Page ](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) (if you are new, then [create a new project first](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) and follow the following steps;

- Click Create credentials > OAuth client ID.
- Select the Web application type.
- Name your OAuth client and click Create
- Remember to provide your domain and redirect URL so that Google identifies the origin domain to which it can display the consent screen. In development, that is going to be `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:3000/login`
- Copy the Client ID and assign it to the variable `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` in your .env file

```
$ cd client
$ npm install (to install client-side dependencies)
$ npm start (to start the client)
```
In the second terminal
- cd server and create a .env file in the root of your server directory.
- Supply the following credentials

```
PORT=8000
URL=
SECRET=
CLIENT_ID=
BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```
```
$ cd server
$ npm install (to install server-side dependencies)
& npm start (to start the server)
```
